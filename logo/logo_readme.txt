Ibidem is Latin for "the same place." You've probably seen its abbreviation, ibid, in bibliographies. Ibidem is apparently a contraction of some kind.
It's written as ib[ide]m to indicate the contraction.The main focus of this product is tagging digital resources with their metadata
(data about the resource, e.g. author, title). When a tag is part of an XML document (which it usually is), it's indicated as <tag name>tag content</tag name>. 
For example: <title>Pilgrim's Progress</title>.So I designed the logo based off of the text ib<ide>m.

The logo was designed using Gimp Shop (http://www.gimpshop.com/).
